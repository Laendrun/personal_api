# API

I want to build myself an API so I can use it to do things on my future projects.

I want it to be connected to a mongodb so I can store information rapidly and easily.

The next project I want to build is a Telegram Bot. \[DONE\]

Maybe a Discord Bot connected to my API ? \[In Progress\]

## Feedbacks

I maybe forgot to remove some config infos, if you see some (secrets, urls, etc).

It'll be great if you tell me, I know, git history will make them visible even if
I remove them.

But when I'll have removed everything, I'll create a new repo so there won't be any way to find them.
